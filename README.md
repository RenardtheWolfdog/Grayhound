# Grayhound

 Grayhound is an open-source PC optimization tool for removing bloatware. It leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to build an always up-to-date threat list by analyzing the latest discussions from IT communities, ensuring the most relevant protection.

## üê∫ Core Features

- AI-Driven Threat Intelligence: Instead of relying on static definitions, Grayhound uses an LLM to generate search queries and analyze web content from IT communities to find the latest bloatware.

- Dynamic DB Updates: The collected intelligence is used to build and update a local database of bloatware, complete with risk scores and reasons.

- System Scanner: Scans your PC's installed programs and running processes against the threat database.

- Clean & Report: Allows you to select and remove identified bloatware, then generates an AI-powered summary of the cleanup process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture
Grayhound operates on a client-server model:

- grayhound_server: A Python-based backend that handles all core logic, including web crawling, AI analysis, database management, and system scanning commands. It communicates via WebSockets.

- grayhound-client: A Tauri-based desktop application (React + TypeScript) that provides the user interface for interacting with the server.

- Optimizer.py: A local agent that runs on the user's machine to perform system-level tasks like scanning files and terminating processes, receiving commands from the main server.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Node.js (which includes npm)
- Rust and the necessary dependencies for Tauri. Follow the official Tauri setup guide for your operating system.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grayhound.git
cd grayhound
```


2. Server-Side Setup (grayhound_server)
First, set up the Python environment and configure the necessary API keys.


2-a. Create Conda Environment
Navigate to the server directory and create a new Conda environment using the provided requirements file.

```
cd grayhound_server
conda create --name grayhound python=3.10 -y
conda activate grayhound
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


2-b. Configure API Keys and Database (config.ini)
You need to provide your own API keys for Google Search, Google AI, and your MongoDB connection string.

In the grayhound_server directory, rename config.ini.example to config.ini.

Open config.ini and fill in the required values.

```
[DEFAULT]
# Google Custom Search API for web crawling
# Get it from: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
google_api_key = YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
# Get your Search Engine ID (cx) from: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
cx = YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID

# MongoDB Atlas connection details for storing bloatware definitions
# Get it from: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
username = YOUR_MONGODB_USERNAME
password = YOUR_MONGODB_PASSWORD
dbname = YOUR_MONGODB_CLUSTER_NAME

[GOOGLE_AI]
# Google AI Studio API Key for LLM-based analysis
# Get it from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
API_KEY = YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never commit your config.ini file with your actual keys to a public repository. The .gitignore file should already be configured to prevent this.


3. Client-Side Setup (grayhound-client)
This sets up the Tauri desktop application.


3-a. Install Node.js Dependencies
Navigate to the client directory and install the required npm packages.

```
cd ../grayhound-client
npm install
```


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You must start the components in the correct order for the application to function properly. Run each command in a separate terminal.

Terminal 1: Start the Local System Agent
This agent listens for commands from the main server to scan your local machine.

```
# Make sure you are in the grayhound_server directory
# and the 'grayhound' conda environment is activated
python secure_agent/Optimizer.py
```

Terminal 2: Start the Main WebSocket Server
This is the core of the application that the client connects to.

```
# Make sure you are in the grayhound_server directory
# and the 'grayhound' conda environment is activated
python Grayhound_Websocket.py
```

Terminal 3: Launch the Tauri Client
This will open the desktop application.

```
# Make sure you are in the grayhound-client directory
npm run tauri dev
```

## üìñ How to Use


1. Update Bloatware DB: The first step is to populate your database. Go to the "Update Bloatware DB" section, select your country and OS, and click "Generate Queries". Review the AI-generated queries and confirm to start the web crawling and analysis process. This may take several minutes.


2. View & Ignore DB: You can view all identified bloatware in the "View & Ignore DB" section. If there's a program you trust, you can mark it to be ignored in future scans.


3. Scan & Clean PC: Go to "Scan & Clean PC" to analyze your system. Review the list of found threats and select the ones you wish to remove. After cleaning, an AI-generated report will summarize the actions taken.
